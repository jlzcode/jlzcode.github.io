Hello, I am **Jiale Zhang**. I obtained my Bachelor's in Information and Computing Sciences from [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/) in 2019 and subsequently completed a Master's in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from the [University of Leeds](https://leeds.ac.uk/) in 2020. For the next two years, I worked as an Algorithm and Application Research Engineer at [Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics](https://www.mindray.com/) in Shenzhen, where I acquired valuable industry experience.


I am interested in researching **Application-driven AI**, **Generative AI models**, and **Machine Learning**.
